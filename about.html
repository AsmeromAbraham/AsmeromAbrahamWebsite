                        <p>This website shows the current standard competitive team composition for Overwatch. The composition is two offensive characters, two tank characters and two support characters. The two offensive characters are mostly situational and should and must be changed to another offensive character in order to better combat the enemy team’s composition. The tanks are a bit more set in stone for the most part. Sometimes if the situation allows a Winston can be used or a Roadhog if you want to get easy picks. Lastly the supports are almost never changed unless if the team’s Ana chooses to switch to a Mercy, which is another great single character healer.</p>
                        <p>When clicking on a character you are taken to that character’s information page where you’ll find some general information about each character, but also a more detailed look at that character’s story and history.</p>
                        <p>All pictures and character information are from Blizzard.</p>
